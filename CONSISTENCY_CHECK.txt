=== CONSISTENCY CHECK COMPLETE ===
Date: Wed 24 Sep 2025 13:15:51 BST

Fixed inconsistencies between Debug-SVMNameDetection.ps1 and Monitor-CIFSSessions.ps1:
1. SVM Filtering: Now both scripts filter for data SVMs with CIFS protocol AND running state
2. AllowedProtocols handling: Now identical in both scripts
3. SVM name detection: Uses same property list and logic
4. Debug output: Added matching SVM properties debug output
